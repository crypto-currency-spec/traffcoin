    "questions": [
      {
        "question": "How much can I start with?",
        "answer": "We recommend starting with a small amount – $153-154. At the initial stage, the main goal is to understand in practice the principles of operation. The output starts from $153-154, if the amount is less, it will come without a profit. In the future, on the 2nd round, you can increase the volume to $400-500, so that the profit received is enough to cover all commissions, and what you earn above this constitutes net profit. Depending on the liquidity on a particular coin (exchange), the maximum volume in transactions may fluctuate."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much can you earn from arbitration?",
        "answer": "You can make 250-300 bucks per day with a deposit of $1000 for 9 circles. Let’s take a minimum of 250 bucks and multiply by 30 days = 7500 $ (our 20% = 1500 $ / your 6000 $). In a conditionally moderate mode of operation, you can earn 1.5-3% of the deposit amount per day, excluding work on high-risk transactions with an increased profit value."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long do ligaments last?",
        "answer": "In general, we recommend paying special attention to bundles in which the sale of the coin must take place on a large, highly liquid exchange (for example, Binance, Bybit, Kucoin, OKX, MEXC) - on these exchanges the price is not as volatile as on other less liquid exchanges, more stable, and this affects the lifespan of the ligament. It is also worth paying attention to the network and the transfer time - for example, in the ERC20, BEP20, TRX, ALGO networks, transactions occur quickly, which significantly increases the ability to work out arbitrage quickly and with maximum profit."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which country can you trade from?",
        "answer": "Unfortunately, each country has its own availability of certain exchanges. Therefore, the use of VPN services has become the norm. Determine by experience which exchanges are available/unavailable from your region and, if necessary, get a VPN service. Our only recommendation here is to try not to use free VPN services."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do exchanges block the accounts of arbitrage traders?",
        "answer": "The main income of any exchange consists of commissions from traders who pay it to the exchange when making any transaction. The more and more often a trader makes transactions, the more the exchange earns. Therefore, no, they don’t block, on the contrary, they make money from it."
      },
      {
        "question": "How secure are my funds?",
        "answer": "We do not accept or store user funds, and do not own information about user accounts and wallets. We only provide access to arbitrage connections that we have discovered on the market. And you make the transactions yourself, using your accounts on exchanges. Regarding security in general, we strongly recommend that you use two-factor authentication on exchanges; Before transferring coins between exchanges, make sure that the transfer network matches between the withdrawal and input wallets. In simple words: You send money from your one exchange to your other exchange (you don’t send us your money, we don’t take any prepayments)."
